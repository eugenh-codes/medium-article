    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>
      In a nutshell, inclusive web design is like putting out a welcome mat that says, <em>"Everyone is invited!"</em> -embracing people with disabilities, and those of us who need glasses or are dealing with cracked screens, too. As you can read, inclusive design isn’t just about making a site accessible to those with the visually impairments. It’s about <span>crafting an experience that’s user-friendly for everyone,</span> making life a bit easier and a lot more enjoyable for all.
    </p>

    <h2>Why does it matter?</h2>
    <p>
      Every design choice you make is <span>a step toward a web utopia</span> where every click, scroll, and interaction glides effortlessly. Embracing an inclusive design approach not only addresses accessibility challenges but also enhances the overall user experience. It’s like adding sprinkles to a cupcake—beneficial for everyone, and it makes the cupcake that much sweeter.
    </p>

    <h2>Who doesn’t like a good challenge?</h2>
    <p>
      Designing for inclusion is like stepping into your superhero cape, using your powers to dismantle barriers and craft a digital playground where everyone can join the fun. So, embrace the challenge with courage and creativity. Remember: when you design with inclusion in mind, you’re not just building a website—you’re <span>making the internet a friendlier place for everyone</span>.
